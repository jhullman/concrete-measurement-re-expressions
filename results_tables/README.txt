strategy_results_tables.xlsx - provides the top ten re-expressions from our Adding Familiar Context, and Reunitization strategies for the set of reference measurements [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, .... 10,000] for each of the four measures. For Adding Familiar Context, we report the mean measurement for each object. For Reunitization, we report the mean measurement and the multiplier. For Proportional Analogy, we provide the top ten re-expressions for a set of reference measurement ratios [1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4, 1:10, 1:100. 1:500, 1:1000, 1:5000, 1:10000] for each measure. We report the error (how far the proportion between the two returned measurements is from the input measurement).
