This folder contains additional analyses we conducted using crowd input to compare our ranked reunitizations to human ranked reunitizations.

comparison_to_human_ranked_reexpressions.pdf - Contains a detailed description of the comparison to human rankings of our reunitizations.

ranking8_clean_result_merged.csv - Contains data on how crowdworkers ranked reunitizations we showed them for different measures and inputs. 

leave_out_term_comparison_results.xlsx - Provides a sample of the leave-one-term-out results for a set of 15 input measurements to allow for more qualitative analysis of how the terms influence the rankings. This Excel workbook contains analyses results from leaving one term out of the reunitization energy function at a time. The first sheet shows the top three reunitizations returned by our solution for the same set of input measurements, either using all three terms (object-measure familiarity, measure variance, and multiplier, labeled FULL) in our energy terms or leaving one term out of the energy function at a time. The second through fifth sheets compare our reunitization solution with all three terms in the energy function (FULL) to those that leave out one term at a time in terms of distance to and correlation with the crowd-based gold standard rankings for the set of input measurements [0.01 â€“ 10000]. The columns vectorMag and vectorSum are measures of the distance between the two pairs of rankings. The columns cor0.01 - cor10000 are the correlations between the crowd rankings and the given ranking. The columm meanCorr is the average correlation between the two pairs of rankings across all input measurements. The columns famweight, multweight, and varweight are the weights of the object measure familiarity term, the multiplier term, and the variance term, respectively.
