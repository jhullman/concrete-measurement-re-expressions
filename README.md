  Measurements Using Concrete Re-expression Strategies. ACM CHI 2018.* 

## Directories


  - **crowdData/** - Data obtained from crowdsourced countability/rigidity and familiarity tasks.
       - **crowd_familiarity** - Judgments of how familiar objects are for re-expressing a range of input measurements (weight, height, length, volume)
       - **crowd_verification** - Judgments of whether an instance is an example of the synset it is intended to represent
       - **rigid_countable** - Judgments of whether a synset is rigid, countable, and purchaseable on Amazon 

  - **evaluation/** - User study and other analyses results for evaluating our tools. 
       - **user_studies** - Directories containing data and R Markdown analysis scripts from each of our three user studies
       - **compare_to_MT_DN_WA** - Reunitizations from three existing solutions for automated reunitization for comparison to our automated reunitization results. 
       - **compare_to_human_ranked** - Summarizes our comparison of our automated strategies' rankings of results to human ranked reunitizations

  - **measureDB/** - Data sets including instance data from Amazon, DBpedia, and Freebase, measurements aggregated by synset, and 
  synset images from ImageNet

  - **results_tables/** - Tables of results for each concrete re-expression strategy
